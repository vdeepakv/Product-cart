# Product-cart

A shopping cart is a key part of any eCommerce website, allowing customers to add, view and remove products from their buying list. It also calculates the total price of the products in the cart, and stores the contents of the cart locally for easy access. Shopping carts make online shopping more accessible and enjoyable. They allow customers to easily add and remove items from their cart as they please, meaning they can find the perfect product for their needs.
